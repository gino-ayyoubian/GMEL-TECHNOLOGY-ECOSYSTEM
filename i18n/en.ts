export const gmel_statement_body = `The GeoMeta Energy Layer (GMEL) is not merely an invention; it is the culmination of years of research, a vision for a sustainable future, and a testament to the power of integrating diverse scientific disciplines. Born from a deep understanding of thermodynamics, geology, and advanced materials, GMEL represents a paradigm shift in how we perceive and harness geothermal energy. Our core philosophy is to create a closed-loop, self-sustaining ecosystem that is not only environmentally benign but also economically transformative. By eliminating the need for environmentally disruptive practices like fracking and moving beyond the limitations of traditional geothermal systems, GMEL opens up vast, untapped energy resources in low-gradient thermal zones previously considered unviable. This technology is designed to be a catalyst for regional development, offering a sovereign solution for energy, water, and strategic resources. The patent portfolio surrounding GMEL is a strategic fortress, designed to protect this vision and ensure its responsible deployment. We are not just building power plants; we are engineering the foundation for resilient, self-sufficient communities and a cleaner planet for generations to come. This project is a commitment to innovation, sovereignty, and the relentless pursuit of a better future.`;
